# Contributing to Kerb Kit
We recommend starting with the [README](/README.md) for a big-picture look at what Kerb Kit is and how it supports the OpenStreetMap community.

## Asset Types

> [!TIP]
> **These Terms May Change**, here is how you can help:
> - Review these definitions and suggest improvements or refinements
> - Share examples or counter-examples if something feels ambiguous

To support contributors and maintain clarity as the project progresses, we've defined a shared vocabulary for the types of visual assets used. While not every definition dictates a strict folder layout, many do imply a consistent structure.

**🛠️ After all, we're laying the groundwork** for a system that's easy to navigate, extend, and maintain.

This shared language helps everyone understand how the pieces fit together conceptually, whether you're creating assets, assembling scenes, or writing documentation. We organize all of our assets in *thematic folders* under the [`library/`](/library/README.md) folder.

### **Environmental Features**

> **Definition:** Physical, real-world elements present in the built environment. These include the things you would observe if standing at the location.

Examples:

- Curbs (flush, raised, lowered, etc.)
- Sidewalks
- Roads and road markings
- Ramps
- Pedestrian islands
- Tactile paving

### **Map Features**

> **Definition:** Abstract representations of how OpenStreetMap encodes physical space and infrastructure. These are typically invisible in real life but critical for tagging and data structure.

Examples:

- Nodes (points)
- Ways (lines)
- Areas (closed polygons)

### **Annotations**

> **Definition:** Explanatory visual aids layered on top of scenes to clarify meaning, highlight tagging logic, or walk the viewer through a diagram.

Examples:

- Callout lines and text
- Highlight bubbles or arrows

### **Templates (or Scene-Templates)**

> **Definition:** Pre-built diagram scenes combining multiple elements for reuse or customization. Templates serve as starting points for creating scenes that support education, outreach, or documentation.

Examples:

- A residential street with an unmarked crossing and a lowered curb
- A street with a crossing island
- A marked crossing with traffic signals
