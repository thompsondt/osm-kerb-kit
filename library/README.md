# The Kerb Kit Graphics Library

Each folder in the library contributes assets along a specific theme. Within each **library folder** you find **asset folders** named according to the asset type: example scenes, annotations, map features, or features of the pedestrian environment.

Folders:
- `shared/` This is a where we keep visual components, utilities, and references that are reused across **multiple themes**.
- `<theme>/` Adds assets to the library along a coherent *theme*.
  - `annotations/`
    - `arrow.svg`
    - `box.svg`
  - `environment/`
    - `physical-thing.svg`
  - `map-features/`
    - `special-node-style.svg`
  - `templates/`
    - `example-scene-001.svg`
    - `example-scene-002.svg`
  - `README.md` instructions or examples showcasing the theme
